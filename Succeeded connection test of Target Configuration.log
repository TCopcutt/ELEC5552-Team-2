This utility has selected a 100- or 510-class product.
This utility will load the adapter 'jioxds110.dll'.
The library build date was 'Jun 25 2021'.
The library build time was '11:45:30'.
The library package version is '9.4.0.00129'.
The library component version is '35.35.0.0'.
The controller does not use a programmable FPGA.
The controller has a version number of '5' (0x00000005).
The controller has an insertion length of '0' (0x00000000).
This utility will attempt to reset the controller.
This utility has successfully reset the controller.

-----[Print the reset-command hardware log-file]-----------------------------

The scan-path will be reset by toggling the JTAG TRST signal.
The controller is the XDS110 with USB interface.
The link from controller to target is direct (without cable).
The software is configured for XDS110 features.
The controller cannot monitor the value on the EMU[0] pin.
The controller cannot monitor the value on the EMU[1] pin.
The controller cannot control the timing on output pins.
The controller cannot control the timing on input pins.
The scan-path link-delay has been set to exactly '0' (0x0000).
